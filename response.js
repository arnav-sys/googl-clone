Resizing of the object in response to resizing of a window in which the object appears can be set to an absolute or proportional basis or constrained to respond to only a vertical or a horizontal change in window size. Alternatively, an object can be centered within a window with reference to the margins of a window, which can be selectively set to change in an absolute or proportional manner as the window is resized. Movement of the object within the window can also be set in both the horizontal and vertical direction on an absolute or a proportional basis. To avoid accumulated round-off errors, the sizing of an object always relates to a dynamic initial position, which corresponds to the position in which the object currently would be if moved by a dynamic action, without regard for positional changes due to resizing of the window.

A propeller for the objects moving in water of the prior art comprises a starch, a scull, a screw propeller, an injector, and the like. The invention uses one or more vanes as the propeller and arranges on the objects moving in water. The vane is mounted by using a hinge or a loose-leaf. The vane can be closed or opened. When the propeller moves back and forth under a driving force in water, the vane automatically closes or opens so as to propel the object to move forward. When the vane is opened, the object is driven by a big propulsive force. When the vane is closed, the object is driven by a small resistance. According to the principle, a swimming shoe is invented. People who cannot swim can have an ability to swim, walk and ramble in water if the shoes are worn. Besides, the invention can replace the widely used flipper and can be assembled on a small boat so as to replace the starch and the scull.",

In an enrollment phase, an object with known identity is measured. The resulting enrollment measurement is stored for future reference. Then in the verification phase, an object presented for verification is measured, and the verification measurement is compared with the enrollment measurement to decide whether or not the two measurements originate from the same object. According to the invention, the enrollment and the verification measurements are modeled as two realizations of a first random variable affected by an enrollment noise and a verification, noise respectively, said enrollment and verification noises being a realization of a second and a third random variable, respectively, said first, second and third random variables having known distributions.",
